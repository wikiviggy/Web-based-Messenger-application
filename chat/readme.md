This was an interesting project overall. I have learned a lot while working on it.

I opted to try my hand at creating some form of a chat application. 
The program is PHP and MySQL based, with a little bit of jQuery/AJAX.
I originally began trying to do a frontend design, which resulted in me
learning about Twitter Bootstrap and what it can do. I decided to change
my focus to the backend. The chat app uses a few classes from Bootstrap 
in addition to MySQL, PHP, and jQuery/AJAX.

I really liked this project because it helped me make connections on how I could use these different technologies to create great things. AJAX, jQuery and Bootstrap were new to me.

My process resulted in a lot of hand-drawings and thinking.
I had a vague idea on how to do it in PHP/MySQL:
Create a form in HTML, get user input, insert data into database, 
get the data and format it in a separate panel. The thing I had to figure out
is how to integrate these newer technologies with my idea on how to execute the project.

I learned a lot about what AJAX and jQuery is good for and researched and practiced a lot
while trying to construct the chat application.

Here is a list of the files:

chatapp.sql - mysql table creation information.

conf.php - php configuration file for connectivity purposes.

shoutindex.html - the main HTML page

shoutglobal.js - relays information to post.php

post.php - inserts user information into MySQL database

getdata.php - retreives the MySQL data.

bootstrap/bootstrap.css - bootstrap file

style.css - basic css
